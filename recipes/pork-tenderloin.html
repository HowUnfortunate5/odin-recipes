    <p>This <strong>baked pork tenderloin recipe </strong>is perfectly juicy and melt-in-your-mouth tender. No searing is required, so it’s fast and has minimal prep! It’s ready in just over 30 minutes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li><strong>Pork tenderloin</strong> - lean and delicious</li>
        <li><strong>Homemade seasoning rub</strong> - brown sugar, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, Italian seasoning, salt & pepper</li>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong> - unsalted</li>
        <li><strong>Chopped parsley</strong> - optional, but good for freshness</li>
        </ul></p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 200F and move the rack to the middle position.</li>
        <li>Prep the tenderloins by cutting off any excess fat and the silver skin (the tough part that may cover some of each tenderloin). Pat the tenderloins dry with paper towel.</li>
        <li>Add the spice rub ingredients (brown sugar, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, Italian seasoning, salt & pepper) to a small bowl and stir together. Coat the tenderloins all over with the spice rub.</li>
        <li>Add the pork tenderloins to a 9×13 (or similar size) baking dish and place the butter pats on top.</li>
        <li>Bake, uncovered, for about 25 minutes or until the pork has reached 62C. Let it rest 5-10 minutes before slicing it into medallions so it remains juicy.</li>
        <li>Pour the pan juices over the pork (they're also great over a side dish like mashed potatoes) and sprinkle with chopped parley if desired.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    </ul></p>
